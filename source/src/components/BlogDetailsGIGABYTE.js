              <h4>Gigabyte</h4>
              <p> Gigabyte Technology was established in 1986 by Pei-Cheng Yeh.

One of Gigabyte's key advertised features on its motherboards is its "Ultra Durable" construction, advertised with "all solid capacitors". On 8 August 2006 Gigabyte announced a joint venture with Asus. Gigabyte developed the world's first software-controlled power supply in July 2007.

An innovative method to charge the iPad and iPhone on the computer was introduced by Gigabyte in April 2010. Gigabyte launched the world's first Z68 motherboard on 31 May 2011, with an on-board mSATA connection for Intel SSD and Smart Response Technology. On 2 April 2012, Gigabyte released the world's first motherboard with 60A ICs from International Rectifier.

In 2023, researchers at firmware-focused cybersecurity company Eclypsium said 271 models of Gigabyte motherboards are affected by backdoor vulnerabilities. Whenever a computer with the affected Gigabyte motherboard restarts, code within the motherboard's firmware initiates an updater program that downloads and executes another piece of software. Gigabyte has said it plans to fix the issues.</p>
